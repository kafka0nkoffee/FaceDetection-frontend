# FaceDetection

A simple REACT app for detecting a face in a picture. Right now, the detection is limited to one face in a picture but the idea is to have it detect all the faces present. 

### Technologies

React.js for front end
Node + Express for backend
PostgreSQL for database.

Currently the app is available at: https://face-detection-frontend.herokuapp.com/
App might be slow to load/respond because of free tier Heroku hosting.
