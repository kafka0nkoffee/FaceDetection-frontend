#FaceDetection

A simple app for detecting a face in a picture. Right now, the detection is limited to one face in a picture but the idea is to have it detect all the faces present. The app uses React for front end, Node + Express for backend and PostgreSQL for database.

Currently the app is available at: https://face-detection-frontend.herokuapp.com/
App might be slow because of free tier Heroku hosting.

If you want to run this app on your local machine:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Go to the backend repo (https://github.com/kikku2506/FaceDetectionAPI) and repeat the same steps.
