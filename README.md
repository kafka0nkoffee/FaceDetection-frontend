# FaceDetection

This project is inspired by a research project during my undergrad involving face matching & sentiment extraction in real-time. Since the source code for the original project is proprietary, this is an attempt to build a modern React app that does the same. 
Currently the app is available at: https://face-detection-frontend.herokuapp.com/
App might be slow to load/respond because of free tier Heroku hosting.

### To-Do

Right now, the detection is limited to one face in a picture but the idea is to have it detect all the faces present and consequently detect faces in moving images i.e. videos.

### Technologies

* React.js for front end
* Node + Express for backend
* PostgreSQL for database.

### Login details

If you want to demo the app you can use the following credentials or register your own profile:
username = admin
password = admin

### Run the App

If you want to run this app on your local machine:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start
4. Go to the backend repo (https://github.com/kikku2506/FaceDetectionAPI) and repeat the same steps.
